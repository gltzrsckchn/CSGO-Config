# Moshis CSGO-Config

That's my autoexec.cfg, config.cfg and additionally my launch options.
I'll might add other stuff in the future, but I'm happy with my settings at the moment.

autoexec.cfg:

Where to put -> ...\steam\steamapps\common\counter-strike global offensive\csgo\cfg

Launch options:

-novid -noborder -high -threads 4 -freq 144 -refresh 144 -tickrate 128 -nojoy +exec autoexec.cfg

Where tu put -> Steam > library > counter-strike global offensive (right-click) > properties > set launch options...
