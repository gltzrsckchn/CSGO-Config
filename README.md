# Moshis CSGO-Config

Just my configs and other stuff I changed. I'll might add other stuff in the future, but I'm happy with my settings at the moment.

autoexec.cfg:

  Where to put -> ...\steam\steamapps\common\counter-strike global offensive\csgo\cfg

-> FPS settings are for 60Hz monitors - so use "Wait for vertical sync" on Double Buffered, Tripple Buffered if you're PC is capable on handling it. (I got pretty hard screentearing without it. If you don't have that at 60Hz, then bump up fps_max so 121 and disable Vsync.)

Launch options:

  -novid -noborder -high -threads 4 -freq 144 -refresh 144 -tickrate 128 -nojoy +exec autoexec.cfg

  Where to put -> Steam > library > counter-strike global offensive (right-click) >
  properties > set launch options...
